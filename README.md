# Learning the Django Rest Framework with a Cinema App

## Introduction

## Requirements
This project requires the following packages to be installed:

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

- A Django app named `api` that contains views and serializers for the REST API

## Usage
To run the project, first ensure that all required packages are installed. Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

python manage.py runserver


This will start the development server and allow you to access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/`. Endpoints are provided for movie and showtime information, allowing you to retrieve and display the data in your own application.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a starting point for learning the Django Rest Framework and building REST APIs. It can be expanded upon to include additional features and functionality as desired. The DRF makes it easy to create powerful and flexible APIs, making it a great choice for any project that requires this type of functionality.
